# A-Level_Project
This is the Newtonian gravity simulator that I made for my A-Level programming project

It is a 2D simulation of the motion of astronomical objects caused by gravity.

Features include:
  - Insert unlimited customised objects into the simulation with an initial velocity
  - Save a simulation and re-open it (saves are stored with text files for simplicity)
  - Display object information directly on the simulation
  - Plot graphs of various different variables relating to each object
  - Demonstrate Keplers second law
