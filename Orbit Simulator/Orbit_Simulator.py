#### orbit programS

### setup
## importing required libraries
import sys  # for exiting python
import time  # for waiting periods of time
import math  # for quickly performing mathematical functions
import pygame  # for all graphics, animation and event handling during the program
import os  # used later for listing the files in a folder
import ctypes  # see next line of code

# compensates for the adjustments made by some computers with high PDI displays that squash application displays down
ctypes.windll.user32.SetProcessDPIAware() 

### getting pygame ready
## initialising pygame
pygame.init()
pygame.display.init()

## defining the pyagame display
# sets the screensize to the resolution of the monitor used and puts the display in full screen
display = pygame.display.set_mode((0, 0), pygame.FULLSCREEN)

# sets display width to the screen's width resolution
width = int((pygame.display.Info()).current_w)
# sets display height to the screen's height resolution

# loads the image for the icon
icon = pygame.image.load('icon.jpg')
#sets the program icon to the image we just loaded in 
pygame.display.set_icon(icon)
#re-scales the icon to fit in the corner of the page
icon = pygame.transform.scale(icon, (30, 30))

#loads the image for the gravitation formulas used later to teach about newtons law of gravitation
gravitationFormula = pygame.image.load('formulas.jpg')
#loads the image for the suvat formulas used later to teach about motion

#loads the image of the colour wheel used to select object colours
colourWheel = pygame.image.load('ColourWheel.png')
#loads the lightness scale - also used to select object colours

##setting up the timing
#sets the number of frames that pass each second to be 120
FPS = 120
#sets the pygame animation clock up
FPSClock = pygame.time.Clock()

##predefining colours for later
#the colours are defined in the following format:
